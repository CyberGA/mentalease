# MentalEase Mobile Application

Mentalease is a mobile application designed to help students who are struggling with psychological trauma or addiction. It is a well-known fact that students dealing with such issues can find it difficult to perform well academically. This is where Mentalease comes in, as not all students can afford the fees of a therapist.

Why it matters: Mentalease aims to bridge the gap and provide free access to qualified mental health professionals to assist students in overcoming any mental health related issues. This will help students to perform better academically and improve their overall well-being.

Infographics: The application offers two types of registration, one for users and the other for therapists. Students can sign up as users, while professionals can sign up as therapists. Authentication is carried out accordingly to ensure that users and therapists can safely access the platform. Users can chat with any therapist to find solutions to their problems.

The United Nations has set targets for mental health goals, and Mentalease aims to contribute to these targets. The therapists on the platform are often volunteers who are dedicated to improving people's mental health, especially that of students.

Mentalease is a simple mobile application that can help solve mental health issues in the education sector. It offers free access to qualified mental health professionals and aims to contribute to the United Nations targets for mental health goals.
